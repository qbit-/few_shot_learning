# few_shot_learning
Here we do experiments with [Fashion Product Images](https://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset/version/1).
We test transfer learning and few shot learning with ResNet50. 

Scripts in the notebooks folder are Jupyter notebooks processes with [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html)
